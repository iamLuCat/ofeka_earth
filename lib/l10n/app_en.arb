    "t6": "The Village Of Iona is located in the southern region of Namibe, a province of the Republic of Angola. This entire region of the African continent, faces desertification due to deforestation, unsustainable agricultural practices and climate change. The lack of rainfall and arid soils is putting the lives of local communities at risk, since they rely a lot on cattle breeding as part of their culture and, as a consequence, have to walk long distances in search of pasture. This poses serious threats to their lives in many different ways: low food reserves, malnutrition, deseases and illiteracy because children are kept out of school to help with cattle breading. There is an urgent need to promote reforestation, sustainable agricultural practices, and access to clean water, and Ngola needs you to prevent the effects of drought and help the communities of Iona to overcome these challenges.",
    "t7": "Plastic is invading schools, neighbourhoods, beaches and rivers in Angola.

    "t8": "Deforestation in Angola is not happening just due to natural causes: There is a battle that we need to fight, against the cutting and burning of trees, which is being done to increase agricultural fields and to produce coal. Join Us to Protect Our Trees And Prevent threatned areas from this massive deforestation! Cutting And Burning Trees Threatens Our Environment And Directly Impacts Vulnerable Communities.
